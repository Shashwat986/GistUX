        <h3>GistUX</h3>
        <p>
          GistUX is a free, open-source tool that reads your <a href="https://gist.github.com" target="_blank">Github Gists</a> and allows you to
          organize them in a directory structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          All you need to get started is to generate a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">Github Authentication token</a>
          and give it the <code>gist</code> scope (which will allow this tool to read your secret gists, and create gists).
          You don't <em>have</em> to provide it with the <code>gist</code> scope, but then you'll be restricted to playing with your public gists.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>NOTE:</b>
          <ul>
            <li><b>This is a purely client-side application. I do not save your gists, or any metadata anywhere. I do not make any third-party API requests.</b></li>
            <li>If you provide this tool access to create gists, it will create a gist called <code>GistUX_&lt;your_username&gt;.json</code> and store everything there.
            <b>The data will NOT be stored anywhere else.</b></li>
            <li>If you do not provide GistUX access, you can view the JSON object and save it locally wherever you want.
            The structure is easy enough to understand, and you can modify it freely.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I've found that, whenever I work on something, I end up creating a very large number of secret gists, and it's hard to categorize them properly.
          This is my solution to that problem. Having said that, this solution is something I'm releasing into the wild.
          There is no warranty of any kind, and I am not liable for any data, errors, security issues, or other problems that may come up with this tool.
          If you're nervous about that, feel free to go through the <a href="https://github.com/Shashwat986/GistUX" target="_blank">code</a>, and help me improve
          GistUX if you see anything lacking.
